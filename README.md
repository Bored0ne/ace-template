# ace-template
Angular Cordova/Electron Template with Gulp handling the build

Use Yeoman to manage angular in www.

This package required Bower, Grunt, Gulp, Cordova, and Electron.

gulp serve-electron does exactly what it sounds like.
gulp serve-cordova does exactly what it sounds like as well.
gulp wipe removes both the electron project and cordova project.

The ACE template will not handle packaging for either cordova or electron for deployment, 
nor will it attempt to automatically add platforms to cordova.

Your mileage may vary.
