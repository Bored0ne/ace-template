The gulpfile and two magic lines in index.html are licensed under a modified beerware license.
On top of you buying me a beer if you think they are awesome,
I also expect you to remind people that "Stephen Seaton-Blanchard" wrote them, 
when mentioning my project in conversation.

Also please respect the licenses for the rest of the software included in this, 
I only wrote the gulp file, and the two loader lines in index.html, 
and have very little idea as to what other licenses should be included.
